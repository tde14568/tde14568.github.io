			<p>Ostriches are one of the most unique creatures in the world. They are well known for being flightless as well as the largest birds on the planet earth. They are natuve to Africa. While there used to be two types of ostriches, the Somali ostrich was unfortunately announced as extinct in 2014. What the ostrich lacks in flight ability it makes up in its ability to cover a world record max speed of around 60 miles per hour. Wow.</p>

		 <p>Ostriches are indeed a very, very rare bird.The common ostrich is the only living species of ostrich on the entire planet. To me, there is not a more fun bird to learn about. They are fascinating to me because of their incredible combination of size and speed. Unfortunately the ostrich species as a whole has suffered tremendously due to extensive hunting throughout history in Asia, the Arabian Peninsula and Africa. The sad truth is that the only place that they currently reside is Sub-Saharan Africa. Thankfully, people have made the effort to preserve the common ostrich so I hope that they will be around forever. The longer that they are on our earth, the more new and interesting facts we can learn about them, such as:</p>

  				<li>Ostriches are omnivores</li>
 				<li>The ostrich is known for eating pebbles, dust and sand so that they grind up food to get it down their gizzard </li>
				<li>Unlike humans, ostriches do not need to drink water</li>
